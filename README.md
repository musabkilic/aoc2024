Learning F# with Advent of Code 2024

in case it is not obvious this is NOT the optimal way to solve these problems, both the performance and the programming experience is horrible
i am doing it in this way because i find it fun and want to see how far i can go
there is some comments and explanations on the commit messages if you are interested(or you may open an issue/contact me somewhere else and ask)
